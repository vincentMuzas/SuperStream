# SuperStream

Node js based streaming site to watch videos with subtitles and multiple audio tracks online.


How to use it?

use FFMPEG to export .mkv files to .mp4 files (only the video stream), then extract the subtitles into .vtt files

the ./extract_video_data.py should do what you want automaticaly (altho it takes a realy long time when converting a full series)


place everything into the /public/Videos folder

tinker with it!
